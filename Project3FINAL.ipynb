    "## Scientific Questions: Which kinases are higher expressed in the phosphorylation of tau protein in regards to Alzheimer's disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in neuron cells and neurofibrillary tangles caused by adnormal hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. These lead to synaptic loss and neuronal death which essentially affects regions of the brain associated with memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have found that the cause of hyperphosphorylation of Tau is heavily linked to kinase phosphorylation, of equal importance are the sites where tau is being phoshporylated. Studies have found that serine 626 is hyperphosphprylated in eary AD progression and before neurofibrillary is formed. (Azorsa, D.O., Robeson, R.H., Frost, D. et al.) Therefore inhibiting these phosphorylating kinases at this stie can be insightful in the development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there are 352 human kinases known to be  able to phosphorylate tau (Cavallini A, Brewerton S, Bell A, et al), which of these kinases are higher expressed in the phosphorylation of tau's epitopes is not widely understood. Several studies have found that translation associated kinases such as GSK3α, GSK3β, and MAPK13 were found to be higher expressed in AD and had  higher activity in phosphorylating all four region of tau's epitopes. (Cavallini A, Brewerton S, Bell A, et al) In order to get data about kinases phosporylation activity,the Qiagen Kinome siRNA librarry screen was used as part of the dataset. "

    "### Scientific Hypothesis: If tau protein is hyperphosphorylated then overexpression of translation-associated kinases will be higher expressed in Alzheimer's disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 352 human kinases known to phosphorylate tau's epitopes that lead to neurofibrallary, studies have found that the direct contributors to the phosphorylation of tau is caused by translation associated kinases such as GSK3α, GSK3β, and MAPK13.(Cavallini A, Brewerton S, Bell A, et al) The Qiagen kinome si-RNA library database was used which contains 572 known and predicted kinases which uses two siRNAs screens, standard paries and two-tailed T-tests to determine the effects of relative non-silencing siRNA in 12E8 (Tau epitope). The data is then organized by gene name (kinase, number of cells transfected, average fold effect, standard deviation, p-values for 12E8, total tau, and ratio of 12E8 tau/ total tau. Where 12E8 refers to tau's epitope serine 262/serine 356. (Azorsa, D.O., Robeson, R.H., Frost, D. et al., 2010)\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer scientific quesition and test my hypothesis, I first had to search for related AD tau phosphorylation research papers that contained their data, I used the database found in the paper \"High-content siRNA screening of the Kinome identifies Kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease related Tau hyperphosphorylation\". By using the kinome siRNA data and screening through it I utilized the data on the kinases of interest (GSK3α, GSK3β, and MAPK13) and compared them to the rest of the kinases in the dataset to identify wheather these translation associated kinases are in fact higher expressed in the increase or decrease pS262 tau phosphorylation.

    "Here I was hoping to have two histograms measuring the average phosphorylation of Tau such that one histogram showed my interest kinases GSK3α, GSK3β, and MAPK13 (translation-associated kinases) and the other histogram containing the candidate kinases proposed by the research paper which consisted of 10 kinases. Through this histogram, I expected to answer my scientific question: Which kinases are higher expressed in the phosphorylation of tau protein in regards to Alzheimer's disease? I hypothesized that translation associated kinases would be higher expressed and hyperphosphorylate Tau protein, I was hoping to find a correlation from my selected kinases to the candidates, where some of the candidates were also linked to translation therefore proving my hypothesis.
