Scientific Questions: Which kinases are higher expressed in the phosphorylation of tau protein in regards to Alzheimer's disease?

This page contains
1) jupytr notebook
2) csv file (Project3_siRNA_data.csv)
    This csv file was obtained from the research article "High-content siRNA screening of the Kinome identifies Kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease related Tau hyperphosphorylation" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20067632/), which contained information on the siRNA levels of 572 kinases that are known to be human phosphorylation kinases. The dataset contained the gene name, average cell count, average fold effect, std, pvalues, total tau, and ratio of 12E8 tau/total tau. 
 
 There is no outputto this code, just the imported data.
